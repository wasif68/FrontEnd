                    CAREERAI PROJECT STRUCTURE GUIDE
================================================================================

This guide explains the complete folder structure and functionality of the
CareerAI application. Everything is organized in a clean, easy-to-understand
way for beginners.

================================================================================
                            FOLDER STRUCTURE
================================================================================

1. src/
   This is the main source code folder containing all application code.

2. src/components/
   Contains reusable UI components that are used across multiple pages.
   These are building blocks like navigation bars, sidebars, and route
   protectors.

3. src/pages/
   Contains the main page components that users see when navigating the app.
   Each file represents a different screen/page in the application.

4. src/services/
   Contains business logic and API-related code. This is where authentication
   and data operations are handled separately from UI components.

5. src/utils/
   Contains helper functions and utility code that can be used anywhere in
   the app. These are small, reusable functions for common tasks.

6. src/data/
   Contains static data files in JSON format. This includes career listings
   and profile field options.

7. src/assets/
   Contains images, icons, and other static media files used in the app.

8. public/
   Contains files that are served directly without processing, like the
   main HTML file and public assets.

9. dist/
   Contains the built/compiled version of the app ready for deployment.
   This is generated automatically when you run "npm run build".

================================================================================
                         HOW PAGES CONNECT
================================================================================

1. User visits app → main.jsx starts → App.jsx loads

2. If not logged in → Redirects to LoginPage.jsx

3. User logs in → authService.js validates → Creates session →
   Redirects to CareerFeed.jsx (home page)

4. User can navigate:
   - Home (CareerFeed.jsx) - See career recommendations
   - Profile (ProfileQuizPage.jsx) - Edit profile
   - Logout (Navbar.jsx) - Ends session, returns to login

7. Career recommendations use helpers.js to match user profile with careers

================================================================================
                         KEY CONCEPTS
================================================================================

LOCALSTORAGE: Browser storage that saves data locally on user's computer.
              Used for: user accounts, profiles, saved items

PROTECTED ROUTES: Pages that require login. ProtectedRoute.jsx checks if
                  user is logged in before allowing access.

AUTHENTICATION: Process of verifying user identity. Handled by authService.js

PROFILE MATCHING: Algorithm that scores careers based on how well they match
                  user's skills and interests. Done in CareerFeed.jsx

COMPONENTS: Reusable UI pieces. Navbar and Sidebar are used on multiple pages.

SERVICES: Business logic separated from UI. authService.js handles all
          authentication logic.

UTILS: Helper functions used throughout the app. storage.js and helpers.js
       provide common functionality.

================================================================================
                         ADMIN ACCESS
================================================================================

Default admin credentials:
- Email/Username: admin
- Password: admin

The admin account is automatically created when the app starts.
Admin can access all features just like regular users.
